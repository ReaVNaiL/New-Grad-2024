## How to Contribute to 2024 New Grad Full-time Positionsüéìüíº

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the 2024 New Grad Full-time Positions repository! We appreciate your help in maintaining and expanding the table of job openings for new grads in various tech roles.

I'll do my best to keep them sorted **[A-Z]** by **company name**. If you see any mistakes or outdated information, please submit a pull request to update them. 

### Need Before You Contribute

<summary><b>Table Example</b> -- click here</summary> <br>

- If you were **ADDING** a job opening for *Walmart*:

| Company Name | Location | Roles | Citizenship/Visa Requirements | Date Posted <br> mm/dd/yyyy |

Placeholders for the table are as follows:
  - `Company Name`: The name of the company.
  - `Location`: The location(s) of the job opening.
  - `Roles`: Any additional Roles or links to the job posting.
    - The "‚úÖ" is not required, but if you still want to add it to keep it consistent with the rest of the repo, you can add it at the beginning of the role listing. 
  - `Citizenship/Visa Requirements`: The citizenship/visa requirements for the job opening.
  - `Date Posted`: The date the job opening was posted. Must be in the format of `mm/dd/yyyy`.

```java
| [Company Name](link-to-job-posting) | Location (s)  | [Position Name](link-to-job-posting)| US Citizen, Permanent Resident, Sponsorship | mm/dd/yyyy |
```

<br>

- If **UPDATING** a job opening, please follow the same format as above, but replace the link to the job posting with the new link, or add a new position name separated by a comma or a `<br>` tag.

| Company Name | Location | Roles | Citizenship/Visa Requirements | Date Posted <br> mm/dd/yyyy |

### Removing A Job Opening

This section is for removing a job opening from the table in the `README.md` file.

It's very similar, assuming you have already forked the repository and cloned it to your local machine.

1. **Find the Job Opening**: Find the job opening you want to remove from the table in the `README.md` file.

2. **Close the Job Opening**: 
    - Simply add a üîí **[No Longer Available]** üîí or üîí **[Closed]** üîí before the Roles or links to the job posting.
    - Then remove the link to the job posting from both the company name and position name. *The parentheses should be empty*
    - Finally, remove the citizenship/visa requirements and replace it with a dash `-`.

<details>
<summary><b>Table Example</b></summary><br>
